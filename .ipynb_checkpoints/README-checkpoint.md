# final-exam

The exam consists of two questions, each worth 50 points. Start early, commit/push to github often, and copy code from our previous homeworks and mid-terms to optimize your effort. Reach out if you have any questions.

***The exam is due by Thursday, December 12th, by 11:59 PM.***

Good luck!!!
